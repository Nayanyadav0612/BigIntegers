# BigIntegers
BigInt ðŸš€ is a C++ library that is useful when we are dealing with Big IntegersðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥. This is a Big Integer Class, implemented in C++, for handling very large numbers, or numbers greater than unsigned long long int in a 64 bit implementation. So, it can easily operate on numbers greater than 10^18.It is capable of performing Arithematic operations like addition,subtraction etc., Finding factorial and performing functions like finding minimum and maximum and absolute value.

Features:
  A) Arithematic Operations
  Addition
  Subtraction
  Multiplication
  Division
  
  B) Increment/Decrement
  Post Increment
  Post Decrement
  Pre Increment
  Pre Decrement
  
  C) Factorial
  
  D) Maximum, Minimum and Absolute Functions
